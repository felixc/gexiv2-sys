Rust FFI declarations for gexiv2
--------------------------------

This crate provides Rust FFI declarations for the [gexiv2][gexiv2] library,
which is a GObject-based wrapper around [Exiv2][exiv2], which provides read and
write access to the Exif, XMP, and IPTC metadata in media files.

Only FFI declarations are provided here; **for a usable Rust library, consider
the [rexiv2][rexiv2] crate**.

This project is considered “complete” — i.e. all the functionality that has been
planned has been added (well, [almost][feature-issues]!), and no new development
work is expected/planned. This doesn’t mean it’s abandoned or unsupported: bug
reports and pull requests are still gladly welcomed and will be addressed.

Documentation
-------------

Documentation is [available online][gexiv2-sys], but since these are just FFI
bindings, it is minimal.

[gexiv2’s APIs][gexiv2-api] may be a useful reference, along with [Exiv2’s
API docs][exiv2-api].

Setup & Dependencies
--------------------

Given that it links to gexiv2, and transitively to Exiv2, gexiv2-sys obviously
depends on them. These libraries are not bundled with gexiv2-sys: you will need
to install them separately.

The minimum supported `rustc` version is 1.63.

For full instructions on how to get started with gexiv2-sys, including how to
install the prerequisite dependencies, refer to the [`SETUP`](SETUP.md) file.


Optional Features
-----------------

**raw-tag-access**: If you need access to the raw byte values of tags, you can
enable this feature and gain the `gexiv2_metadata_get_tag_raw` function. Note
that the return value of this call is a GLib [`GBytes`][gbytes] object, which
you can convert to a data pointer via GLib’s [`g_bytes_unref_to_data`][unref].

This feature is disabled by default because it introduces a new dependency on
[`glib-sys`][glib-sys], and consequently on the GLib system library.

**xmp-packet-access**: If you need access to the XML-formatted XMP packet, you
can enable this feature. It will add the `gexiv2_metadata_generate_xmp_packet`
and `gexiv2_metadata_get_xmp_packet` calls. Enabling the feature also introduces
a new dependency on the the [`bitflags`][bitflags] crate.
